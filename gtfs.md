### Summary
<b>Context:</b> This was a project for my SE 2030 class at MSOE.
<br /><br />
<b>Process:</b> We started as a group by designing a UML class diagram for our program. Then, we slowly built up each of our program's features over the remainder of the project time.
<br /><br />
<b>Task:</b> We aimed to design and implement a program that contained several features for parsing, viewing, and editing GTFS files, which could then be used by people in a transit agency.
<br /><br />
<b>Deliverable:</b> This was spread out over several weekly labs, so there were different deliverables that needed to be provided for each week. Ultimately, we needed a functional program in our repository that covered all of the requirements of those labs, and we also presented this program to the class after it was done.
<br /><br />
<b>Time Constraints:</b> We started this project in the beginning of October, so there was about a month to implement everything for the final program (though since this was split up into multiple labs, some features needed to be implemented earlier).
<br /><br />
<b>Other Constraints/Challenges:</b> The program needed to take in any possible set of files, whether or not they were valid GTFS files, without throwing an uncaught exception.
<br /><br />
<b>Team/Individual:</b> This was a team project. My role was to contribute code for the program's features and address some of the issues that we ran into as a group.
<br /><br />

### Analysis
<b>What I did well:</b> I was good at making sure that the rest of the group did everything that they planned to do, putting together the deliverables for many of the labs. I also paid special attention to the timing of our program, creating a utility to benchmark imports and exports with and see where the slowest parts of our program were.
<br /><br />
<b>New skills/knowledge:</b> Before this project, I had little experience developing software in a group. With this project, I learned how to manage a code repository in a group, including branching, issue tracking, and merge/pull requests. This project also helped be brush up my Java knowledge, since at that point, it had been three months since I worked with it.
<br /><br />
<b>What went well:</b> We did a good job at thoroughly testing our program before calling it finished for each lab. Our group was the only one that never ran into an issue while demonstrating our program to the professor. We were also good at dividing up our work, as everyone always had tasks that we needed them to do, and everyone made roughly equal contributions to the program.
<br /><br />
<b>What could use improvement:</b> Time management was a big one. Often, we would all wait until the last day or two before a lab was due to pick up the pace working on it. Another area was commenting our code better while writing it, as many of the comments in our code were added after-the-fact by someone other than the person who wrote the code.
