### Summary
<b>Context:</b> This was a project for my SE 2030 class at MSOE.
<br /><br />
<b>Process:</b> We started as a group by designing a UML class diagram for our program. Then, we slowly built up each of our program's features over the remainder of the project time.
<br /><br />
<b>Task:</b> We aimed to design and implement a program that contained several features for parsing, viewing, and editing GTFS files, which could then be used by people in a transit agency.
<br /><br />
<b>Deliverable:</b> This was spread out over several weekly labs, so there were different deliverables that needed to be provided for each week. Ultimately, we needed a functional program in our repository that covered all of the requirements of those labs, and we also presented this program to the class after it was done.
<br /><br />
<b>Time Constraints:</b> We started this project in the beginning of October, so there was about a month to implement everything for the final program (though since this was split up into multiple labs, some features needed to be implemented earlier).
<br /><br />
<b>Other Constraints/Challenges:</b> The program needed to take in any possible set of files, whether or not they were valid GTFS files, without throwing an uncaught exception.
<br /><br />
<b>Team/Individual:</b> This was a team project. My role was to contribute code for the program's features and address some of the issues that we ran into as a group.
<br /><br />

### Analysis
<b>What went well:</b> We did a good job at thoroughly testing our program before calling it finished for each lab. Our group was the only one that never ran into an issue while demonstrating our program to the professor.
<br /><br />
<b>New skills/knowledge:</b> Before this project, I had little experience developing software in a group. There was a new element of
