    <h3>Bright, Hard-Working, Gets the Job Done</h3>
    I'm a bit of a busy bee, currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at MSOE. I grew up in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and I work with computers in many respects during my free time, especially coding for vintage and embedded systems. I inherited many of those from my dad as a kid. I also enjoy time with family and pets, which has been becoming more precious as time goes on.
