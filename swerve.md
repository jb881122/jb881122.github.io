### Summary
<b>Context:</b> This was part of the software for the robot built by FIRST Robotics team 7619 (IllumiBOTi) at Lincoln High School for the 2020 season.
<br /><br />
<b>Process:</b> I and another member of the team developed two sets of code that drove our robot. We then combined them to get one working set of code.
<br /><br />
<b>Task:</b> For the team as a whole, the task was to build a robot that would be most capable for earning us points for the FIRST Robotics Infinite Recharge game.
<br /><br />
<b>Deliverable:</b> Working code that could be used for driving our robot. As a team, that code would be used in competitions for the tournament.
<br /><br />
<b>Time Constraints:</b> We had several months for the entire robot, with several weeks for the swerve drive code while the robot itself was being built. Ultimately, the season was cut off after a couple of smaller competitions in March of 2020 due to the pandemic.
<br /><br />
<b>Other Constraints/Challenges:</b> The code needed to reliably run without breaking when the robot was out on the field, including recovering from tricky scenarios.
<br /><br />
<b>Team/Individual:</b> The swerve drive was a team effort, with contributions mainly from two individuals. My role was to implement it and work with the other person who implemented it to get the best program for the job.
<br /><br />

### Analysis
<b>What I did well:</b> I adjusted to the syntax of the Java language fairly quickly and was able to start writing code for the robot almost right off the bat.
<br /><br />
<b>New skills/knowledge:</b> I gained experience with the basics of the Java programming language, and I was able to refine my geometry knowledge when writing the program.
<br /><br />
<b>What went well:</b> The robot was able to navigate (in the classroom, at least) using my code, and at the end, we were able to make an effective program for driving the robot. 
<br /><br />
<b>What could use improvement:</b> Being new to the language, I was often using Google to figure out how to do things without fully understanding the code. I ended up making liberal use of threads, which seemed to work when we were testing it in the classroom, but it broke when running it out on the field.
